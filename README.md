%%% this scripts takes a FTIR image from a cary agilent 630, where it has
%%% already been normalised. It then kemans the image and displays it next
%%% to an H&E section of an adjacent section of the FTIR imaged slice. The
%%% user can then use a freehand tool to draw around parts of the kmeaned
%%% image while the H&E section is displayed next to it. 
%%% the PURPOSE is so the user can look at the H&E section and pick out ROI
%%% on the FTIR image based on the H&E image
